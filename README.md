# UdpCLientFinalForm
This is the GUI appplication for the Socket repository under the name of Coen445. They are both able to run separately, but are codependent when it comes to results.

## How to Use
First make sure that you already have the Coen445 and the UdpClientFinalForm repository already installed on your PC. Run the COen445/Server solution and then run the UdpClientFinalForm.
Wait until Server 2 is serving on the Server's console. When that happens, click on the "default" button on the client GUI and change the port number to any number greater or smaller than 5080 but NOT equal to it.
Once this happens, you should be able to see the message sent to the server's console and a response from the server on the textbox.
If you made any mistakes, the error will be printed on the client's larger textbox.
