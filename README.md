# UdpCLientFinalForm
This is the GUI appplication for the Socket repository under the name of Coen445. They are both able to run separately, but are codependent when it comes to results.

## How to Use
Ensure that there is a server running on a machine from the Coen445 branch. There can only be a maximum of two servers running in total (whethher it be on the same or different machines). Run the client and change the default server addresses in the client to the real ones displayed by the servers. Once done, click on the register button to connect to the active server. If  successful then the client has now been registered to the server.
